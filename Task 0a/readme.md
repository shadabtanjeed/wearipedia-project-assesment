# Task 0.a

---

This folder contains the solution to the questions in Task 0.a.

You can view the solution PDF: [task_0a_assesment.pdf](https://github.com/shadabtanjeed/wearipedia-project-assesment/blob/task-0-a/Task%200a/task_0a_assesment.pdf)

**Notes:**
- There may be minor mathematical calculation errors, but the main foundation remains the same.
- The notebook in Task 0.b mentions the highest resolution for `intraday_Spo2` is per 1 minute during sleep. However, according to the official Fitbit API documentation, the highest resolution found is per 5 minutes during sleep, so that was used in the solution.
